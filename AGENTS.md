- Read the README.md for basic project understanding.
- Always create tests to verify any new functionality
- Remember to also update javadocs (all classes and methods must have a description, all params must be listed and return and throws specified when appropriate) where needed.
- All tests must pass after the implementation using `mvn -Dspotless.check.skip=true test` to ensure that there is no regression.
- Adhere to the coding standard defined in checkstyle.xml, pmd-ruleset.xml and spotless-formatting.xml and also pay attention to the design principles of low coupling, high cohesion, clarity and DRY (don't repeat yourself).
