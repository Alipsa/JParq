**Please add support for the `ROLLUP` clause as described in the SQL:1999/2003 standard.**

`ROLLUP` is a syntactic shortcut defined in the SQL standard for generating a **hierarchical sequence of subtotals**, culminating in a grand total. It is logically equivalent to a specific, ordered set of `GROUPING SETS`. Its primary purpose is to simplify the generation of hierarchical summary reports.

-----

### Key Characteristics According to the SQL Standard

The `ROLLUP` operation generates subtotals by successively removing the *rightmost* column from the grouping list, creating a fixed hierarchy. For $N$ columns, `ROLLUP` generates $N+1$ aggregation levels.

  * **Hierarchical Aggregation:** `ROLLUP(A, B, C)` generates the following groupings: $$(A, B, C), (A, B), (A), ()$$

  * **Syntax:**

    ```sql
    SELECT 
        column_A, 
        column_B, 
        Aggregate_Function(column_C)
    FROM 
        TableName
    GROUP BY
        ROLLUP (column_A, column_B); -- Equivalent to GROUPING SETS ((A, B), (A), ())
    ```

### The `GROUPING` Function

The standard **`GROUPING(column)`** function must be supported to distinguish summary rows generated by `ROLLUP` from true detail rows.

  * **Output:** `GROUPING(column)` returns **1** if the column is currently being aggregated out (holding a summary `NULL` value) and **0** if the column is part of the current grouping set.

-----

## Example using the `mtcars` Dataset

We will use `ROLLUP` to calculate the **Total Horsepower (`hp`)** based on the hierarchy: `cyl` -> `gear` -> Grand Total.

```sql
SELECT
    cyl,
    gear,
    SUM(hp) AS Total_HP,
    -- Use GROUPING to label the subtotals in the hierarchy
    CASE
        WHEN GROUPING(cyl) = 0 AND GROUPING(gear) = 0 THEN 'Detail Subtotal'
        WHEN GROUPING(gear) = 1 AND GROUPING(cyl) = 0 THEN 'CYLINDER TOTAL'
        WHEN GROUPING(cyl) = 1 AND GROUPING(gear) = 1 THEN 'GRAND TOTAL'
        ELSE 'Error'
    END AS Group_Level
FROM
    mtcars
GROUP BY
    ROLLUP (cyl, gear) -- Generates: (cyl, gear), (cyl), ()
ORDER BY
    cyl NULLS LAST, gear NULLS LAST; 
```

### Example Output (Partial)

|   cyl    |   gear   | Total_HP | Group_Level        |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-------------------|
|    4     |    3     |   109    | Detail Subtotal    |
|    4     |    4     |   487    | Detail Subtotal    |
|    4     |    5     |   113    | Detail Subtotal    |
|  **4**   | **NULL** | **709**  | **CYLINDER TOTAL** |
|    6     |    3     |   243    | Detail Subtotal    |
|    6     |    4     |   120    | Detail Subtotal    |
|  **6**   | **NULL** | **538**  | **CYLINDER TOTAL** |
|   ...    |   ...    |   ...    | ...                |
| **NULL** | **NULL** | **4329** | **GRAND TOTAL**    |

## Implementation Requirements

### 1\. Core Feature Mapping

  * The implementation must recognize **`ROLLUP (col1, col2, ...)`** syntax within the `GROUP BY` clause.
  * The `ROLLUP` operation **must be internally translated** into the equivalent, standard set of `GROUPING SETS` before execution.
      * Example: `ROLLUP(A, B)` -> `GROUPING SETS((A, B), (A), ())`

### 2\. `GROUPING` Function Support

  * The output must correctly populate the summary rows with `NULL` for the rolled-up columns.
  * The `GROUPING(column)` function must correctly return **1** for summary `NULL` values generated by the `ROLLUP` process.

### 3\. **Testing Requirements**

  * Create tests to verify the functionality in a test class called **`jparq.group.RollupTest`**.
  * Tests must cover:
      * Simple `ROLLUP(A, B)` and verification of the N+1 result levels.
      * Correct calculation of totals/subtotals.
      * Correct output of the `GROUPING(column)` function across all rows.
  * Adhere to all coding standards (Checkstyle, PMD, Spotless).
  * Remember to also update javadocs (all classes and public methods must have a description, all params must be listed and return and throws specified when appropriate) where needed.
  * All existing tests must pass after implementation using `mvn -Dspotless.check.skip=true verify`.
