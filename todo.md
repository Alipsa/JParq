- OR support: evaluate the JSQLParser Expression directly in JParqResultSet (instead of materializing into a flat list of AND’d Conditions). That unlocks OR, parentheses, and more complex expressions with minimal extra complexity.
- IN support (e.g. select * from mtcars where cyl in (6,8))
- LIKE support (e.g. select * from mtcars where model like 'Toyota%'), and NOT LIKE (e.g. select * from mtcars where model not like 'Toyota%').
- BETWEEN support (e.g. select * from mtcars where mpg between 20 and 30)
- IS NULL and IS NOT NULL support
- ORDER BY: buffer matched rows (for small files) and sort via a comparator from JSQLParser’s OrderByElements.
- Predicate pushdown: map a subset of =, <, >, <=, >= on primitive columns to Parquet’s FilterPredicate for big speedups.
- Alias support (e.g select model as type from mtcars)
- expose an INFORMATION_SCHEMA with tables/columns via in-memory result sets, slim deps with shading/exclusions to get a leaner jar.
- GROUP BY support
- HAVING support
- Aggregation Functions supoprt (min, max, count, avg, sum)
- CAST support
- EXISTS support
- JOIN support (join, inner join, left join, right join, full join)
- UNION support
- CASE support
- COALESCE support
- ANY support
- ALL support
- COMMENTS support
- string functions support
- numeric function support
- date functions support
